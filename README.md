# DATA-VIZ__DATA-SCIENTISTS-JOB

## A data visualization project. 



At this time, My first-semester final examination has been over, and I have a couple of days to select my optional subject for next semester. I have three optional subjects where I have to choose one of them. My preferable subject is deep-learning. However, To take an effective decision I use this workshop to analyze some data about data scientist job fields to see which subjects are most demanded right now.


Here, you'll find the  data set  which I have used for this workshop:
